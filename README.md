# radio

## disclaimer
this app was 95% generated with Github Copilot, using prompting and Copilot Edits. We clearly see the bad structure in the css and html files.

But the needed features are there, so when it works, it works...

If you need to modify the styles, it's quite confusing unfortunately. I'll try to fix it maybe.

## config

- the radio streams are set in `streams.json`
- radio images are stored in `media/`
- the alarm audio file played when the timer reaches 00:00 is `media/alarm.mp3`
